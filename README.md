# Sales-Requisition-App
This solution serves to automate requisition process of an organisation in order to improve tracking of resources ,make the process faster with the added benefit of better record keeping which would lend itself easily to analysis.

## App Demo


## Solution Justification
This solution arose to solve the problem been faced by Contoso a fictitious company that is into sales of pefumes,creams and other skincare products.
At Contoso as part of their advertisement strategy their sales reps often go out into the field to promote their products. when they are going on such company trips they will need certain resources such as a company car,some product samples.

In order to get these resources they would have to write a letter to their manager and await approval and this often slowed down the company and wasting valuable time of employees as a result of this manual system which could be better spent on tasks that require critical thinking to actually move the company forward and increase their sales.

This solution automates the requisition process at Contoso and makes tracking of requests made by individual sales reps seameless as well .


## Solution Approach 
In solving the problem being faced by Contoso after consideration we came up with this approach.
Built our app so the sales reps can request for the resources they might need on this screen. 

All requests made by the sales reps can also be seen on this screen as requests shown change based on the sales rep currently making use of the app.

There's also the admin screen where executives can view all of the requisitions made by the sales team and also filter down to each individual sales rep as well as by what they requisitioned to know the pace at which items are being requested and plan accordingly.


This solution would significantly cut down time spent on requisitions process.
